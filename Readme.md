# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## JavaScript Fundamentals

### My Tasks

Is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * I will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average. (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

When I open my code in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following and the final code should print the analysis to the console.


  ```text

  ```
